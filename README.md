# Machine-Learning-for-Breast-Cancer-Classification-With-ANN-and-Decision-Tree
Breast cancer is one of the commonest cause of cancer deaths in women. It starts developing when threatening bumps start forming from the breast cells, and unfortunately most diagnoses happen in later stages, thus resulting in low chances of survival for the patient. So for early detection and prognosis, it is necessary to detect the benign or threatening nature of the bumps. In this paper, Artificial Neural Networks (ANN) and Decision Tree (DT) classifiers are used to develop a machine learning (ML) model using the Wisconsin diagnostic breast cancer (WDBC) dataset, in order to evaluate the attributes of a breast cancer development at beginning phases and classify it as malignant or benign. In the proposed scheme, feature selection and feature extraction are done to extract statistical features from the dataset and comparison between the models is provided based on their performance to identify the most suitable approach for diagnosis. The dataset apportioned into various arrangements of train-test split. The presentation of the framework is estimated, depending on accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, precision, and recall. The binary classification problem achieved a maximum accuracy of 98.55%.
